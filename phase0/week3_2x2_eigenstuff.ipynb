    "An **eigenmode**(also reffered to as **eigenfunction**, which I like more tbh) is a function that satisfies the following statement:\n",

    "$\\text{Let } L : V \\to V \\text{ be a linear operator}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Let } f \\in V \\text{ and } f \\neq 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Then } f \\text{ is an eigenmode of } L \\iff \\exists \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F} : L f = \\lambda f.$\n",

    "In essence an eigenmode is just an eigenvector, but it's allowed to be dependent on a variable\n",

    "Note a few things:\n",
    "- As with any linear operator, we *can* and usually *do* describe it using an $n \\times n$ matrix.\n",
    "- $\\vec{x}(t)$ depends on what it was a moment ago according to rate models, which makes logical\n",
